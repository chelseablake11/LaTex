\location{December 2015 – Present | Biddeford, ME}
Working under \textbf{\href{http://www.une.edu/people/michael-arciero}{Michael Arciero}} on Theoretical Mathematical Research on rational ratios of frequencies to create musical notes compared to western musical even tempered tuning with an irrational frequency ratio on the order of $2^\frac{1}{12}$. Thesis to be written and submitted for publication. 
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{UNE School of Pharmacy}
\descript{| Pharmaceutical Research in Computational Chemistry}
\location{May 2015 – August 2015 | Portland, ME}
Worked under \textbf{\href{http://www.une.edu/people/olgun-guvench}{Olgun Guvench}} on computational pharmaceutical. Used Bash, VMD, NAMD, CHARMM, and other computer languages to make simulations of various molecules. The focus of this research was on biglycan, an important molecule in the body. As the end product of the research, the first biologically relevant simulation of biglycan was created.  Publication submitted. Also taught the basics of chemistry to a class of fourth and fifth graders at Howard C. Reiche Community School in Portland Maine. Finally, recreated a website for the Guvench Lab.  \textbf{\href{http://guvenchlab.org/}{guvenchlab.org}}.
